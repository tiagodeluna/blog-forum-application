                    <p>Luna Forum is a simple forum webapp developed by Tiago Luna (me) as part of the Vanhack Accelerator 
                    Program. It was written using <strong>React.js</strong> + <strong>PureCSS</strong> in the Frontend, 
                    and <strong>Java 8</strong> + <strong>Spring (Boot, WebMVC, Security, Data)</strong> + 
                    <strong>MongoDB</strong> in the Backend. I hope you enjoy my solution!</p>
